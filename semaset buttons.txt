"Set All" - sends all the settings to the module one by one. Useful for loading settings from file then downloading to module, e.g. replacing a failed module. Don't forget to click on "Store", see below, before turning off the power.

"Run" - stop streaming settings to the module. After a short delay the module will return to normal operation but using the currently configured settings. Again don't forget to click on "Store", see below, before turning off the power.

"Set" - streams value for whichever setting is currently selected with the radio buttons to the module. For positions settings servo will track, at its full speed, the setting slider. For speed settings servo will move according to appropriate input but changes to the speed value will take immediate effect (roughly equivalent of: "Run"; "Set"; Change a speed setting; "Run"; Toggle input).

"Store" - tells the module to copy the current settings to EEPROM. Settings are copied from EEPROM when power is applied to the module.

"Reset" - tells the module to copy the current settings from EEPROM, i.e. forget any changes since the last "Store". Equivalent of removing then applying power to the module.

"Centre" - centres the value slider and set value accordingly.

Value can be changed directly by: Double click in the value box so value figures are highlighted; Type desired value; Press "Return" (or "Enter") on keyboard and slider will jump to the appropriate position.

In the "Select COM Port" dialog entering "0" put's the utility into "Offline" mode. settings can be loaded, changed, and saved but no commands are sent via any serial ports.
